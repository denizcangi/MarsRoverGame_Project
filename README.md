# MarsRoverGame_Project
Sabanci University Fall 2020-2021 Term CS405 3D Mars Rover Collusion Project 

In this Mars Rover Game, I used OpenGL which is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Also in the project I used GLFW 3.3.2 OpenGL library. For OpenGL loading library (OpenGL function loader) I used GLAD.
Also you need glm to run the game.

To play the game:

UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT buttons of the keyboard move the rover and the camera moves with the rover.
If you press the button C then the camera starts to move independently from the rover. In the independent camera mode, you can use mouse cursor to change the perspective of the camera, also you can use UP, DOWN ,RIGHT, LEFT buttons of the keyboard to move the camera. 
When you press the button V again, the camera position and perspective move back to the position and perspective before you pressed the button C. Now you can go on with your game and move your rover with UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT buttons of the keyboard.
During the game, you can always use mouse scroll wheel to zoom in.

The enemy rovers always try to catch you, and when one of them catches you, your rover turns into black color and enemy rovers colorsâ€™ turn into green.
After the game finished, you can not move the rover again but you can move the camera independently as it is in independent camera mode.

Have fun!
